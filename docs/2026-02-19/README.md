# 2026-02-19 Tasks

## Context

Tasks 1-2 (staging deploy + Vercel wiring) completed 2026-02-17. The app is live at `https://utter-wheat.vercel.app` backed by staging Supabase project `jgmivviwockcwjkvpqra`.

## Ordered tasks

1. **Standalone auth pages**
   Path: `auth-pages/README.md`
   What it achieves: replaces the current account-sidebar auth component with dedicated `/login` and `/signup` pages that feel like a proper entry point to the app.

2. **Qwen official API wiring/cutover**
   Path: `docs/qwen-integration/tasks/11-rollout-cutover.md`
   What it achieves: transitions TTS runtime from Modal-first toward official Qwen API integration.

## Dependency

Task 1 has no dependency on Task 2 — they can be worked in either order or in parallel.
