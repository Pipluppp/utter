# Status — Feb 8, 2026

Phases 01 through 07 of the Supabase backend migration are complete. The local stack (Supabase CLI + Edge Functions + React frontend) runs end-to-end on localhost. Auth is wired up — password sign-up/sign-in works instantly against the local Supabase instance (email confirmations are off for dev, so no Inbucket step needed for password flow).

We also did an initial frontend deployment to Vercel, separate from the migration phases. The React SPA is live on a Vercel preview URL, deployed from `refactor/backend-db-supabase`. There are no API rewrites yet — the deployment is purely the frontend for navigating pages and showing the landing. Pages that need backend data (Voices, History, Generate, etc.) degrade gracefully with error messages instead of crashing. The full API rewrite to Supabase Edge Functions comes later in Phase 10.

A few bugs surfaced during the Vercel deployment and were fixed: demo media files for the landing page weren't being committed (`.gitignore` pattern was too broad), the waveform player had black-on-black bars in dark mode due to a React effect ordering issue (ThemeProvider now uses `useLayoutEffect`), and API calls that received HTML instead of JSON (from the SPA fallback) now show clean error states instead of parse crashes.

Next up is Phase 08, which is a manual QA and security validation pass. It requires two browser sessions (normal + incognito) with two separate test users to verify RLS isolation, end-to-end CRUD flows, WaveSurfer CORS behavior, PostgREST hardening, and a security sweep. Nothing to build — just structured testing and fixing whatever fails. After that, Phase 09 is staging deploy and Phase 10 is the full Vercel deployment with API rewrites pointing at Supabase.
