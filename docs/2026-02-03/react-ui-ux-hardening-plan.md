# React UI/UX hardening plan (redirect)

This document is kept for backwards compatibility with older links.

The active, detailed implementation plan now lives at:

- `docs/2026-02-03/post-frontend-refactoring-fixes-plan.md`

That plan covers:

- Button/action sizing consistency across pages
- Voices/History long-text layout fixes (actions stay pinned)
- Minimal "i" Info tips grounded in backend constraints
- Clone/Design copy and form UX adjustments
- No new backend API endpoints required
