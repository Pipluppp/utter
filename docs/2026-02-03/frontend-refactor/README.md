# Frontend Refactor Docs (React + Tailwind)

This subfolder contains the source-of-truth documents for the React/Tailwind frontend rewrite.

## Documents

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **[react-refactor-plan.md](./react-refactor-plan.md)** | End-to-end plan to migrate the frontend to React + Tailwind |
| **[frontend-inventory.md](./frontend-inventory.md)** | Ground truth map of current pages/behaviors/state/API calls to preserve |
| **[react-frontend-guidelines.md](./react-frontend-guidelines.md)** | Guardrails to keep the rewrite appropriately simple |

## Codex skills (available in this repo/session)

This repo currently exposes these Codex skills:
- `frontend-design`: build/beautify UI components/pages with high design quality
- `tailwind-design-system`: Tailwind CSS v4 design tokens + component patterns
- `web-design-guidelines`: audit UI against Web Interface Guidelines (UX + accessibility)
- `skill-creator`: create/update a custom skill (turn our conventions into a repeatable workflow)
- `skill-installer`: install additional skills (curated list or from a repo path)

Recommended usage:
- Use `tailwind-design-system` while defining tokens/components in the React rewrite.
- Use `frontend-design` when building or polishing page/component UI.
- Use `web-design-guidelines` to audit finished UI for accessibility and interaction quality.
