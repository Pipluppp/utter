# Legacy frontend implementation plans (Jinja/vanilla)

These plans were written against the legacy Jinja/vanilla pages under `backend/templates/`, but they remain valid as UX requirements for the React rewrite (parity + polish).

| Plan | Goal |
|------|------|
| **[history-search-voice-highlight-plan.md](./history-search-voice-highlight-plan.md)** | Search History by voice name + highlight matches |
| **[design-preview-playback-fix-plan.md](./design-preview-playback-fix-plan.md)** | Fix `/design` preview play button not playing |
| **[voices-page-improvements-plan.md](./voices-page-improvements-plan.md)** | Tag clone vs designed voices, show reference transcript, add Voices search + pagination |
