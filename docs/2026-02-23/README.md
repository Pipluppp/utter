# 2026-02-23 Initial Goal Plans

## Context

These are initial, human-readable planning docs for the next major workstreams. They are intentionally lightweight so we can refine scope, sequencing, and implementation details in follow-up discussions.

## Priority order

1. **Security + Supabase hardening**
   Path: `security-supabase/README.md`
   Why first: protects paid APIs, user data, and system integrity before further monetization and provider expansion.

2. **Credits management foundation**
   Path: `../2026-02-24/credits-management.md`
   Why second: enables accurate usage accounting, plan enforcement, and pricing UX.

3. **Qwen API integration**
   Path: `../2026-02-24/qwen-integration.md`
   Why third: should land on top of hardened auth/rate-limit controls and credit enforcement.

## Notes

- These are goal plans, not final implementation specs.
- Each doc includes assumptions, initial scope, and acceptance criteria to guide next planning sessions.
