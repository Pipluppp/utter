<div class="about-content">
    <h2>Voice Cloning</h2>
    <p>To create a voice clone, simply upload a clean audio recording. The model analyzes the prosody, timbre, and
        accent to create a digital replica.</p>

    <h2>Constraints & Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Length:</strong> Reference audio should be between 10 seconds and 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>File Formats:</strong> We support WAV, MP3, and M4A.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Use high-quality audio with minimal background noise for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> Currently optimized for English speech.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy & Ethics</h2>
    <p>Voice cloning technology should be used responsibly. Only clone voices you have permission to use. This project
        runs entirely locally using open-source models.</p>
